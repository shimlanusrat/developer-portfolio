                <h1>A Motivatinal Story</h1>
                <h2 class="orange-color">Our Fixed Mindset</h2>
                <p>A gentleman was walking through an elephant camp, and he spotted that the elephants weren’t being
                    kept in cages or held by the use of chains.

                    All that was holding them back from escaping the camp, was a small piece of rope tied to one of
                    their legs.

                    As the man gazed upon the elephants, he was completely confused as to why the elephants didn’t just
                    use their strength to break the rope and escape the camp. They could easily have done so, but
                    instead, they didn’t try to at all.
                    Curious and wanting to know the answer, he asked a trainer nearby why the elephants were just
                    standing there and never tried to escape.The trainer replied that-</p>
                <h4>“when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age,
                    it’s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away.
                    They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.”</h4>
                <p>The only reason that the elephants weren’t breaking free and escaping from the camp was that over
                    time they adopted the belief that it just wasn’t possible.</p>
